Expectations:
  1. Create a CPU
  2. Code an assembler that inputs ARM assembly and outputs an image file
  3. Load image file into instruction memory of the CPU

Steps to Success:
  1. Created a CPU in Logism Evolution
  2. Coded an assembler in Python 
  - Takes ARM assembly code and converts it to an image file that my CPU could read
  3. Coded a simple ARM assembly file that would be passed through my assembler
  4. Image file is outputed and is able to be loaded directly into my CPU
  5. Boom! A fully functioning CPU
